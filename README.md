# JAEGR

Explain your startup or idea. 
JAEGR is an innovative mobile application that leverages augmented reality (AR) technology to transform outdoor environments into immersive gaming arenas. Utilizing the advanced capabilities of smartphones, such as AR, GPS, camera, and gyroscope, JAEGR introduces a "search and find" gameplay where players form teams to locate and tag opponents in real-time. The game's unique feature, the JAEGR scope (an AR scope), allows players to mark opponents by pointing their phone at them, with accuracy improving as more team members target the same location. This feature not only enhances the gaming experience but also encourages physical activity and social interaction among players. Our vision is to merge the digital and physical worlds in a way that creates meaningful connections and exciting adventures in everyday locations.
