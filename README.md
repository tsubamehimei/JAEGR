# JAEGR

Explain your startup or idea. 

JAEGR is an innovative mobile application that leverages augmented reality (AR) technology to transform outdoor environments into immersive gaming arenas. Utilizing the advanced capabilities of smartphones, such as AR, GPS, camera, and gyroscope, JAEGR introduces a "search and find" gameplay where players form teams to locate and tag opponents in real-time. The game's unique feature, the JAEGR scope (an AR scope), allows players to mark opponents by pointing their phone at them, with accuracy improving as more team members target the same location. This feature not only enhances the gaming experience but also encourages physical activity and social interaction among players. Our vision is to merge the digital and physical worlds in a way that creates meaningful connections and exciting adventures in everyday locations.

What is your value proposition, target market, and product differentiation 

Value Proposition: JAEGR offers a unique blend of physical activity, social interaction, and gaming excitement. Unlike traditional mobile games, JAEGR encourages players to explore their surroundings, cooperate with teammates, and engage in healthy competition, making it a unique and immersive AR experience. The game stands out by providing an innovative use of AR technology that promotes physical activity and social connections, filling - we believe - a gap in the current mobile gaming market.

Target Market: Our primary target market includes young adults and teenagers who are enthusiasts of video games, outdoor activities, and AR technology. Additionally, we aim to attract casual gamers looking for new and exciting ways to stay active and connect with friends. JAEGR's design will appeal to a broad demographic, including both frequent gamers and those seeking leisure activities.

Product Differentiation: JAEGR differentiates itself through: 
a) Innovative Gameplay: Utilizing AR and smartphone sensors to create a unique "search and find" experience.
b) Social Engagement: Encouraging team formation and collaboration in real-world settings.
c) Physical Activity: Promoting physical activity as a core component of gameplay.
d) Accessibility: Designed to be accessible and engaging for a wide range of players, with features catering to different abilities and interests.
e) Educational / Advertising Elements: Once the core game play is up and running, integrating learning opportunities about local history and geography or advertising through exploration can be implemented. 

Our application not only introduces a new way of gaming but also fosters a community of players who appreciate technology, physical activity, and social interaction.
